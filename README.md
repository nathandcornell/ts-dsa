# Typescript Data Structures and Algorithms

This is just a place for me to practice and maintain my muscle memory for the most-common (or missing, in the case of Heap!) data structures and algorithms in Typescript.

Basically I write the tests, then regularly delete the implementation and rewrite it from memory.

Feel free to use them, fork this, or if you see a way to strengthen the tests, please do!
